The two components that are known to be not working are tradesubmitter.js and tradeutils.js. They both are missing some error checking on their inputs and are having trouble santizing what they receive. The static analysis does not show these problems, however, mostly it indicates problems of style with the code. We have since fixed all of the above errors and are now getting no error messages from the static analysis. We have also allowed our test suite to properly indicate code coverage and we get a fairly high coverage.
